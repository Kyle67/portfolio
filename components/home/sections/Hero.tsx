            In 2013 my programming interest really sparked with my interest in
            how games worked and even briefly looking at Minecraft server plugin
            development (although I didn&apos;t get far at the time). Then for a
            while my true interest in development kind of flatlined (aside from
            constant consideration of how things worked and could hence be used
            in gaming) until I started my double degree at university of
            Mathematics & IT. Over the time of my degree I got to experience a
            large number of languages including but not limited to (.....). I
            think this combination of Maths & IT was invaluable to the skills
            and processes it provided for my development processes. Some of
            these key skills include critical thinking and .... .

          <Text>
            This then only further propelled my interest in development as I
            decided to persue a Masters in IT majoring in Software Development.
            This not only allowed me to further my understanding and attain
            experience in key real world practices via Cloud Computing, Real
            world projects & a Web & Mobile development unit which real ignited
            my passion for web development (which prior to that I hadn&apos;t
            been all that interested in.)
